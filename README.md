# CSC-584-Project-File
This repository contains all of my projects and lab assignments for my studies. Most files used for this subject are JSP, java, HTML, XML and other languages.
You can view those codes, and download or execute them using the NetBeans IDE 8.2 (a newer version may also be used).
